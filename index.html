	   <h2>Measuring Specific Heat Capacity</h2>
	   <p>The <span class="hc">calorimeter</span> is an apparatus used in experiments that involve exchange of heat between two bodies at different temperatures. The materials used in building this device are usually good conductors of heat e.g <span class="hc">Copper, Aluminium.</span> This is so that the heat loss to the surroundings is minimized and a more accurate result is gotten<br>The most common method employed in calorimeter experiments is known as <span class="hc">method of mixtures</span><br>In this method, a hot substance e.g omi gbigbona😉😁 <span id="principle">is</span> mixed with a cold substance e.g omi tutu😂</p>
	   <p>The principle behind the experiment is that the heat lost by the omi gbigbona must be always be equal to the heat gained by the omi tutu...<span class="hc">important!</span></p>
	   <p>In a real world experiment however, we assume the omi gbibona is a metal with an unknown specific capacity and the omi tutu is water itself. The reason that is done is because we already know the specific heat capacity of water which is <span class="hc">4200 Jkg–¹K–¹</span> but me no know how they get am, I plan to ask them one day sha🤔😎😁</p>
	   <p>Our aim now is to find the specific heat capacity of the metal, it could also be vice versa</p>
	   <p id="formula">Lemme just chip this in before we move on<br>
	   	Heat energy has a formula as regards this kinda situation<br>
	   <span  class="hc">H=mC&#8710;&theta;<br>
	   H=Cp&#8710;&theta;<br></span>H represents heat energy<br>
	if you've forgotten what<span class="hc"> m, C and Cp</span> represent, then go over to the previous boxes,<br>
	And just for emphasis sake,<br><span class="hc">&#8710;&theta;</span> represents change in temperature, i believe you already know that😉
	 </p>
	 <p>You, yes you<br>
	 Snap back to reality, what were we talking about? Its how to find the specific heat capacity of a random metal, shey you're following beyen😈😼</p>
	 <p>Alright, let's move on<br>
	 So since the heat lost by that metal is equal to the heat gained by water, we can therefore imply that<br>
	<span class="hc">Hm=Hw</span><br> where<span class="hc"> Hm</span> is the heat of the metal not heat capacity oo and <span class="hc">Hw</span> is the heat of water<br><br>
	According to our <a href="#formula">formula</a>, we can therefore say ;<br>
   since <span class="hc">Hm=Hw</span><br>
  <span class="hc"> MmCm&#8710;&theta;m = MwCw&#8710;&theta;w</span> (<span class="hc small-text">it should be noted that i used Mm here because there was no way to differentiate it using a mobile device so make sure you always use small m and underscore of whatever you're doing in a real exam</span> )
   </p>
   <p>Alright, so our formula has been proven, so lets go to a nice example<br>
    Ummm, change of plans, in this example, we're going to be finding the specific heat capacity of the liquid not that of the metal, its all the same , you just have to equate the heat of the two materials, again i say heat not heat capacity and then,it can also be two liquids or two metals, the <a href="#principle">principle</a> still applies

	<div class="inside-div">
	<h2>Example</h2>
	Carry your pen and paper at this point🤗🙂
    <p>The question is;<br>
    	A piece of copper weighing 400grammes is heated to 100&#xb0;C and then quickly transferred to a copper calorimeter containing 100grammes of a liquid of unknown specific heat capacity at 30&#xb0;C. If the final temperature of the mixture is 50&#xb0;C, Calculate the specific heat capacity of the liquid. (Specific heat capacity of copper = 390 Jkg–¹K–¹)<br><br>
    	Solution;<br>
    	We have copper and a liquid in this example<br>
    	So let's say;<br>
    	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Heat of copper = <span class="hc">Hc</span><br>
    	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Heat of Liquid = <span class="hc">Hl</span><br>
    	<span class="hc">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hc=Hl</span><br>
    <span class="hc">&#x2234;&nbsp;McCc&#8710;&theta;c = MlCl&#8710;&theta;l</span> <br>
    l and c represent the liquid and copper, don't forget!<br>
    So let's identify all those blablabla😌🥱 parameters right away<br>
    <span class="hc">Mc</span> = mass of copper = <span class="hc">400grammes</span><br>
    <span class="hc">Cc</span> = Specific Heat Capacity of Copper = <span class="hc">390 Jkg–¹K–¹</span><br>
    <span class="hc">&#8710;&theta;c </span>= initial temperature of copper - final temperature of copper( which would be temperature of the mixture since copper and the liquid now have the same temperature at end point)
    <span class="hc">&#8710;&theta;c </span>= 100(initial)-50(final)=<span class="hc">50&#xb0;C</span><br>
    <span class="hc">Ml</span> = mass of liquid = <span class="hc">100grammes</span><br>
    <span class="hc">Cl</span> = Specific Heat Capacity of Copper = <span class="hc">? unknown, that's what we're going to find so say x </span><br>
    <span class="hc">&#8710;&theta;l </span>= initial temperature of liquid - final temperature of liquid<br>
    <span class="hc">&#8710;&theta;l </span>= 30(initial)-50(final)=<span class="hc stop">20&#xb0;C (Wondering why it's not -20,it's because change is neither positive or negative, It is what it is ! 😋)
    </span><br>
    So back to this;<br>
    <span class="hc">&nbsp;McCc&#8710;&theta;c = MlCl&#8710;&theta;l</span> <br>
    so now we have;
    400&times;390&times;50 = 100&times;X&times;20<br>
    so after solving;<br>
    <span class="hc">X=4777.5Jkg–¹K–¹ </span>(never forget the unit!💔)<br>
    And that's how we've come to the end of this part of the topic, heat is broad topic and much more broader than this so you should also solve more examples and become a pro<br>
    But before we round up, let's summarize what we've learned👇

<div id="summary"></div>
<div class="fourth-div all-divs col-xs-12 container-fluid">
	<div class="inside-div">
	<h2>Summary</h2>
	<p>So we learned a few things;
		<ul>
			<li>Heat capacity (Cp) of a body is the quantity of heat required to raise the temperature of that  body 1 kelvin or 1&#xb0;celsius
			</li>
			<li>
				The specific heat capacity (C) of a body is the quantity of heat required to raise the temperature of a unit mass of that body by 1 kelvin or 1&#xb0;celsius
			</li>
			<li>
				The calorimeter is used to measure specific heat capacity
			</li>
			<li>Good conducting materials like copper and aluminium are used in the method of mixtures experiment so as to minimize heat loss</li>
			<li>
				The principle guiding the method of mixtures procedure is that the heat lost by the hotter material(s) is/are always equal to the heat gained by the colder material(s)
			</li>
		</ul>
		And here are a few tips and suggestions;
		<ol>
			<li>Always remember to use the correct units i.e g, kg , j, k, c as the question demands</li>
			<li>Never forget the first😂</li>
			<li>Alright, jokes apart, you should also solve more on this, no knowledge for the lazy man😁</li>
		</ol>
		And that would be all, i really hope you enjoyed reading this, give me your feedbacks, reviews and whatsoever advice on my <a href="https://wa.me/+2348148774367" target="_blank">whatsapp number </a><br>
